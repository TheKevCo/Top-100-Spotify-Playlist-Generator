# Top-100-Spotify-Playlist-Generator
This application generates a spotify playlist from the top 100 songs on a specified date. Utilizes WebScraping from the Billboard Website and uses Spotipy Module.

From my experience, this program doesn't necessarily fail to query for a song, but will add in a song that might not be exactly from the billboard website. I tried enhancing the accuracy by scrapping for the artist and querying both the artist and the song name.
